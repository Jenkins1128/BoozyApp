# BoozyApp

About:

Boozy App is a mobile application intended for people looking for the nearest happy hour featuring the types of food, drink, or beverage they may want. We believe that there is a gap in the bar and restaurant referral services offered by Yelp that can be bridged.  Our goal was to build additional functionality beyond Yelp that enables users to review and add items to a happy hour menu for others to see. By using the Yelp model, we intend to do this in a way that is fun, familiar and easy to use.
